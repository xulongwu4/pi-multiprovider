Pi normally owns **one stored credential per provider**. `pi-multiprovider` adds a second, provider-scoped credential store and lifts the provider's native stream in place. Each request leases an account, resolves that account's auth, and delegates to the original provider without inventing aliases such as `zro-2` or changing the selected model.

If an account fails before visible output, the lift can cool it down and retry another account inside the same logical stream. Once text, thinking, or a tool call is visible, replay stops—duplicate output is worse than a surfaced error.

## Why multiprovider?

| | Capability | What it does |
| :-: | --- | --- |
| 🔐 | **Multiple credentials** | Store API keys and provider-native OAuth credentials per provider. |
| 🪄 | **`/multilogin`** | Reuses Pi's searchable provider selector and login dialog, then opens a searchable settings-style pool manager for drilling into every row inline. |
| 🔀 | **Four pool strategies** | Round robin, weighted round robin, least in flight, or priority failover. |
| 🔃 | **`/switch-account`** | Session pin to one pooled account for the current model—restored when the session is resumed; pool settings untouched. |
| 🧬 | **Upstream merge** | Optionally treats Pi's normal `/login`, `auth.json`, environment, or ambient credential as another account—editable inline like any stored account. |
| 🩺 | **Health-aware leases** | Tracks in-flight work, failures, cooldowns, session affinity, and retry exclusions. |
| ♻️ | **In-place reauthentication** | Re-run a provider login for an existing account and swap its credential without losing label, weight, priority, or session pins. |
| 🛡️ | **Stream-safe failover** | Suppresses a rejected attempt's start/error events and retries only before user-visible output. |
| 🧱 | **Error tolerance before switching** | Absorbs up to 3 pre-output errors on the same account before failing over, so one blip never pays a cold-cache switch. |
| 🪪 | **Stable identity** | Provider ID, model ID, model picker entries, routing, and session history remain unchanged. |

## Install

Requires Node.js 22.19+ and Pi 0.84.3+.

```bash
pi install npm:pi-multiprovider
```

The npm package registers the extension automatically. Install the provider extension you want to pool as usual; for example:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-zro-provider
pi install npm:pi-multiprovider
```

<details>
<summary>Other install methods</summary>

From the new GitHub repository:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/monotykamary/pi-multiprovider
```

From a local checkout:

```bash
bun install
bun run build
pi install /absolute/path/to/pi-multiprovider
```

For one development run:

```bash
pi -e /absolute/path/to/provider-extension \
   -e /absolute/path/to/pi-multiprovider/extensions/multiprovider.ts
```

</details>

## Quick start

Start Pi after installing both extensions, then run:

```text
/multilogin
```

The flow:

1. Searches providers and authentication methods exactly where Pi's `/login` UI does.
2. Opens the pool manager, a settings view mirroring Pi's `/settings`: fuzzy search, inline value cycling, and drill-in submenus.
3. The **Add account** row asks for a non-secret label and runs the provider's own login implementation—including pasting an API key for providers without an interactive flow—then returns to the manager.
4. Every other row edits live settings: pool strategy and session affinity, an **Accounts** section grouping every pooled credential—**Pi default (upstream)** plus stored accounts—with per-account weight (traffic share) and priority (failover order), and scheduler cooldowns.

Add as many accounts as you need from the same manager. Remove credentials from an account's submenu or with `/multilogout`; Pi's regular `/logout` and `auth.json` remain independent. **Reauthenticate** in a stored account's submenu re-runs the provider's own login flow and replaces that account's credential in place — label, weight, priority, and session pins stay, and the account's cooldown clears. Use it when a provider revokes or invalidates a refresh token (for example `refresh_token_invalidated`) instead of removing and re-adding the account.

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/multilogin [provider]` | Open the pool manager: strategy, affinity, upstream, account, and scheduler settings, plus adding or removing accounts. |
| `/multilogout [provider]` | Remove an account saved by `/multilogin`. |
| `/vprovider [id]` | Create and edit virtual providers that map one model across multiple provider models. |
| `/accounts` | Inspect pool policy, account status, in-flight leases, failures, and cooldowns. |
| `/switch-account [label]` | Pin this session to one pooled account of the current model's provider, or return to automatic selection. The choice is restored the next time the session is resumed. |

## Pool strategies

| Strategy | Selection behavior | Good for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Round robin** | Starts at the first healthy account in pool order (the **main account**) and spills over to later accounts only while earlier ones are unavailable. Unbiased pools rotate through healthy accounts in pool order from a random starting account, and differing weights shape traffic shares. | A primary subscription with backup accounts. |
| **Weighted round robin** | Uses smooth weighted scheduling. | Accounts with different quotas or spend limits. |
| **Least in flight** | Selects the healthy account with the least active work. | Concurrent agents and uneven request duration. |
| **Priority failover** | Uses the lowest-priority number until it becomes unhealthy. | Primary/backup credentials. |

First-account bias keeps every new session on the account listed first in the pool—**Pi default (upstream)** when included, otherwise the first stored account—so you stop seeing sessions start on a backup account while the main one has plenty of usage. Integrations that want even request rotation register with `selectionBias: 'none'`, which restores the classic rotate-through-healthy-accounts behavior: accounts rotate in pool order (the order they are configured, never re-sorted by id), the rotation starts at a random account so restarts do not favor the same one, and differing per-account weights share traffic smoothly instead of being ignored.

Session affinity can pin a healthy account to the current Pi session. Explicit retry exclusions always win, so a rejected account is not selected twice for the same logical request. Switch strategies, affinity, and per-account weight and priority at any time inside `/multilogin`. `/switch-account` sets the pinned account explicitly for one session without touching these settings. Pi Fabric participant agents inherit that pin through `PI_MULTIPROVIDER_SESSION_PINS` and rebind it to the child session, so spawned workers keep the operator's chosen account.

### Error tolerance and failover compaction

A rejected account is not abandoned on the first error. Each stream absorbs up to `errorsBeforeSwitch` (default **3**, configurable in the `/multilogin` Scheduler panel) pre-output errors on the same account—separated by a short pause—before releasing the lease, applying the failure cooldown, and moving to the next account. Errors after output has started and non-retryable failures surface immediately, exactly as before.

When [pi-fabric](https://github.com/monotykamary/pi-fabric) is installed, failing over to a different account first compacts the session with fabric's deterministic, LLM-free compaction engine. The failing request surfaces its error, the session compacts while the retry backoff runs, and the retry lands on the next account with a small context instead of a huge cold prefill. This is the default behavior; without fabric installed, streams rotate accounts inline as before.

## Virtual providers

A virtual provider maps **one model to multiple provider models**. Sessions are spread across the backing providers with unbiased round robin—no first-provider favoritism—while session affinity pins each session to one backend, so prompt caches stay warm between requests and every subscription sees roughly its share of sessions.

Create one with `/vprovider`:

1. Choose **Create new virtual provider**, then set the provider id and virtual model id.
2. Add one or more **backing provider models**—pick any registered provider and one of its models from a fixed-height, type-to-filter list. Toggle, reweight, or remove backends at any time.
3. **Save and apply**. The virtual model appears in `/model` under the virtual provider's id.

Behavior details:

- Each request resolves auth at the backing provider layer: the provider's own ambient credential (Pi `/login`, auth.json, environment) or, when the backing provider has a multiprovider pool, its pooled accounts with their own failover.
- A failing backend fails over to the next one before any output streams; the failed backend cools down under the same scheduler policies as account pools.
- `/switch-account` works on virtual models too: pin the session to one backing provider model, or return to automatic rotation.
- Virtual provider configs are stored (credential-free) in `multiprovider-auth.json` next to the account pools.
- Mixing backends from different model families is allowed, but the virtual model advertises the first healthy backend's context window and pricing, and prompt caches never transfer between providers.
- Virtual models capture each backing model's metadata (reasoning support, thinking-level map, context window, pricing) when you pick it, so `/thinking` and per-model thinking memory (pi-model-sort) work across restarts and session resume — even before backing providers register. Stored configs are healed automatically on the next session start.

## Switching accounts for one session

`/switch-account` lists every account pooled under the current model's provider—including **Pi default (upstream)** while its credential is configured—and pins the choice to the current Pi session:

- The pin is session-scoped. Pool strategy, affinity, weights, and priorities stay untouched. Every switch is recorded in the session file as a custom entry that is never sent to the model, so resuming the session restores the last switched account instead of falling back to the pool strategy.
- New requests from this session use the pinned account, even while the pool's session affinity is off.
- If the pinned account cools down, another account serves temporarily and the session returns to it once it recovers. Removing or disabling the account drops the pin for the rest of the session.
- **Automatic**—or `/switch-account auto`—clears the pin so the pool strategy selects again; the cleared state is recorded too, so a resumed session stays automatic.
- `/switch-account work` switches directly when the label matches exactly or by unique prefix.
- If the pinned account was removed or disabled before the session is resumed, the session warns once and falls back to automatic selection.

In-flight requests keep their leased account; only new requests observe the switch. Sibling extensions can follow switches—and the account a resumed session restores—through the [`pi-multiprovider:service` event](#session-account-service-event).

## How auth merging works

Pi still owns its one normal provider credential. Multiprovider owns additional credentials:

```text
~/.pi/agent/auth.json                    Pi /login and normal credential
~/.pi/agent/multiprovider-auth.json      extra pooled credentials
```

`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` relocates both files in the usual way. The multiprovider file is:

- created with mode `0600`
- written through same-directory atomic renames
- protected by a cross-process lock with stale-lock recovery
- versioned for future migrations
- never included in `/accounts` snapshots or logs

API-key credentials use the provider's native `resolve()` method, including provider-scoped environment values. OAuth credentials use the provider's native `login()`, `refresh()`, and `toAuth()` methods; refresh runs under the account-store lock with Pi's five-minute validity window.

When **Pi default** is enabled, the lifted auth method first lets Pi resolve its normal credential. Multiprovider marks only the names—not values—of credential-specific headers and environment fields. If a stored account is selected, stale upstream auth fields and credential-specific base URLs are removed before transport.

Inside `/multilogin` the **Pi default** credential appears in the pool's account list like any stored account: relabel it, raise or lower its weight (default 1) and priority (default 0), or disable it so only multilogin accounts run. When no pool exists yet but `/login` already has a credential configured, it is listed as pending so it can be preconfigured before the first stored account. The credential value itself stays Pi-owned—rotate or replace it through `/login`. Pool, account, upstream, and scheduler settings persist alongside the credentials in `multiprovider-auth.json`. The manager's **Scheduler** section overrides the global failure cooldowns live: rate limit (60s), quota (15m), auth (5m), transient base (1s, doubling per consecutive failure), and the 60m cap.

## Failover semantics

An account can be retried when all of these are true:

1. The provider failed before text, thinking, or tool-call output became visible.
2. The failure is account-local or transient.
3. Another enabled account is healthy and has not been attempted.

Default retry classes include:

- HTTP `401`/`403`, invalid keys, tokens, grants, or expired credentials
- HTTP `402`, quota exhaustion, or out-of-credit messages
- HTTP `429`, rate limits, overload, or too-many-requests responses
- HTTP `408`, `425`, and `5xx` transient failures

The lift sets provider-local retries to zero by default so there is one retry owner. Provider integrations can override classification and cooldown duration.

### Real ZRO proof

The implementation was exercised against the actual sibling `pi-zro-provider` and two independently stored LocalTerm credentials. Secret values were passed only through process environment into isolated mode-`0600` test stores and were never printed.

| Probe | Result |
| --- | --- |
| First stored ZRO API key, no `ZRO_API_KEY` environment fallback | `ZRO_FIRST_OK` |
| Second stored ZRO API key, no `ZRO_API_KEY` environment fallback | `ZRO_SECOND_OK` |
| Priority-1 synthetic invalid key → priority-2 valid key, same `zro/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` stream | `ZRO_FAILOVER_OK` |

The package also has direct Pi runtime probes and 31 deterministic tests covering scheduling, session account pinning, the service announcement, stream integrity, cancellation, secure storage, concurrent mutation, OAuth refresh locking, upstream auth scrubbing, upstream preference persistence, scheduler settings, pool-only availability, and simulated API-key/OAuth login flows.

## Provider integration API

The built-in managed store works with native providers and legacy `pi.registerProvider()` configurations composed by Pi. Providers with an existing account inventory can register their own opaque references instead:

```ts
import { registerMultiProvider } from "pi-multiprovider";
import type { ExtensionAPI } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";

export default function providerExtension(pi: ExtensionAPI) {
  registerMultiProvider(pi, {
    id: "example",
    label: "Example",
    accounts: async () => [
      {
        id: "work",
        label: "Work",
        authKind: "api-key",
        credentialRef: "opaque:work",
        weight: 2,
        priority: 1,
      },
      {
        id: "backup",
        label: "Backup",
        authKind: "oauth",
        credentialRef: "opaque:backup",
        priority: 2,
      },
    ],
    async resolveAuth(account, signal) {
      return resolveProviderOwnedCredential(account.credentialRef, signal);
    },
  });
}
```

Credential references are intentionally opaque. Account inventory, refresh, billing, quota, and provider-specific metadata remain provider-owned. Re-announce after a provider re-registers dynamically; the bundled extension also reconciles its lift before every agent run.

### Session account service event

The bundled extension announces a small in-process service on `pi-multiprovider:service` (emitted at load and on session start) so sibling extensions can follow the session's active pooled account—for example, to refresh account-scoped subscription usage views after `/switch-account` or a resume:

```ts
import {
  MULTIPROVIDER_SERVICE_EVENT,
  type MultiProviderServiceAnnouncement,
} from "pi-multiprovider"

pi.events.on(MULTIPROVIDER_SERVICE_EVENT, value => {
  // Duck-check value.getActiveAccount / resolveActiveAccountAuth /
  // onActiveAccountChanged, or cast to MultiProviderServiceAnnouncement.
})
```

- `hasPool(providerId)` — `true` for a registered scheduler pool with an integration, `false` for a confirmed unpooled provider, and `undefined` before or during reconciliation (including after a failed initialization). Only explicit `false` permits the ordinary upstream credential path. This synchronous check does not read accounts or resolve credentials and is independent of session affinity. Capability-check this optional method for older service implementations; a missing method is also unknown.
- `getActiveAccount(providerId, ctx)` — the session's explicit `/switch-account` pin, else the scheduler's last selection while pool affinity is on. A selected upstream account is returned with id `pi:default`. `undefined` alone does **not** prove the provider is unpooled: with `hasPool(providerId) === true` it means no account can currently be identified, and account-sensitive consumers should not fall back to another login.
- `resolveActiveAccountAuth(providerId, ctx, signal?)` — resolves (refreshing OAuth under the account-store lock when needed) the active stored account's credential as `{ accountId, accessToken, label, source? }`. `accountId` identifies the exact account passed to the resolver, even if the session selection changes while it runs. Older implementations may omit it. Compare it to the selected account before attributing usage. Returns `undefined` for a selected upstream account, missing selection, or resolution failure; only a known `pi:default` selection should use upstream credentials.
- `onActiveAccountChanged(providerId, callback)` — fires after `/switch-account` pins or clears, and when a session start replays a recorded pin (resume, fork, or session switch). The event carries the triggering `ctx` and the new active account—`undefined` when the replayed decision returned the session to automatic selection—so account-scoped widgets repaint with the restored account instead of waiting for their next poll. Listeners attached after a replay can rely on their own session start, which observes the already-restored pin.

The extension re-emits the same service object before and after each reconciliation, including login/logout and external pool updates. Keep subscriptions attached, but recheck readiness and quota state on **every** announcement even if object identity is unchanged. `createServiceAnnouncement` callers composing their own lifecycle may supply `isReady()`; omitting it means the scheduler is already initialized.

The service reports selection, not a guaranteed record of the last request: explicit-pin failovers can use another account while retaining the pin. The token's `accountId` guarantees credential attribution, not which account served an earlier request.

Credential values are never broadcast in the event payload itself; only extensions that invoke the resolver receive them, and the private `multiprovider-auth.json` store is never read directly by consumers.

For direct composition, the public package exports `MultiProviderService`, `liftProvider`, `MultiAuthStore`, `createManagedIntegration`, `mergeProviderAuth`, and all scheduler/integration types.

## Safety boundaries

- **No replay after output.** A failure after any content event is surfaced unchanged.
- **No secret snapshots.** Public account state contains labels and health only, never credential references or credential values.
- **Case-insensitive header replacement.** Selected auth replaces matching headers and can remove obsolete auth fields.
- **Lease lifetime equals stream lifetime.** Success, failure, and cancellation release capacity exactly once.
- **Provider re-registration is expected.** The extension re-lifts current provider objects before agent execution, covering dynamic model refreshes used by provider packages.
- **Health is in memory.** Cooldowns and implicit session affinity reset when Pi reloads or replaces the extension runtime; credentials, pool settings, and the `/switch-account` decisions recorded inside a session persist with it.

Current limits:

- Deferred fetch/cancel operations are not lifted yet; `stream` and `streamSimple` are the supported failover paths.
- A broken or revoked OAuth credential in Pi's primary `auth.json` can fail during Pi's pre-stream refresh before account selection. Repair that one through Pi's own `/login` (`/logout` first when the old credential blocks the flow) — multiprovider never writes it. Pooled credentials refresh independently and can be repaired in place with **Reauthenticate** in the `/multilogin` account submenu.
- If both a stored pool and a provider-owned integration register for one ID, the stored pool wins and Pi displays a warning.
- Provider-owned integrations with a custom `affinityKey` are invoked with a minimal context by `/switch-account`; keys that depend on request message history cannot be reproduced there and fall back to the Pi session id.
